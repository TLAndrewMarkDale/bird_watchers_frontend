## You've found an interesting bird, but you don't know its species.

Want to find out what it is? To classify your image, simply drag and drop an image or click on the upload box and select the image of the bird you found. We've built a machine-learning model using 525 species of birds. More than likely, you can find the answer you're looking for! Want to know more? Click on the information icon at the top right of the page.

## Using our application

Simply drag & drop or click and upload an image. Once uploaded, click classify. You will then receive the classification based on the species in our data! Want to classify another? Simply click clear to clear the data from the page. Repeat this process!

## A little about the project

This website was created to help amateur birdwatchers identify the species of birds they find. The machine-learning model used in this website was trained on 525 species of birds. The model is capable of classifying images of birds with high accuracy. To classify an image, simply drag and drop an image or click on the upload box and select the image of the bird you found. More than likely, you can find the answer you're looking for! There are over 9700 species of birds, and they can be found in various habitats around the world. Birds are known for their colorful plumage, melodious songs, and diverse behaviors. Birdwatching is a popular hobby that allows people to observe and appreciate the beauty of birds in their natural habitats. That being said, it can be challenging to identify the species of birds, especially for beginners. This website aims to make bird identification easier and more accessible to everyone. We are not able to train our model on every bird species; however, this should serve as a good starting point for bird identification. If you are unable to find the species of the bird you are looking for, we recommend consulting a field guide or a bird expert for further assistance. Happy birdwatching!

This website was created by Andrew Mark Dale and Andre Dallaire for the final project of AIDI-2000 Applied Machine Learning at Durham College.
